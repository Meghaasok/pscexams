        </p>
        <h4><u>Purpose</u></h4>
        <p style="line-height:25px;">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The need for quality education along with scholastic and soft skills is more evident than ever as we raise our children today. It is our purpose to 				provide high quality education, which is centered on continuous and comprehensive evaluation, remedial teaching and monitoring. The skills developed through smartindia includes the 				ability to think critically, creatively, innovatively and analytically. It  also involves the ability to apply knowledge and understanding in different situations.

The critical thinking skills, skills to organize and interpret data and information, skills to formulate questions and the ability to 				analyse issues that confront communities are greatly addressed in the meticulously designed test series of smartindia.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height:25px;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smartindia helps the student to be independent and self – regulated in learning as well as acquiring skills and new knowledge, through smart corners, 			remedial lessons and class notes. Besides this, students are also expected to develop an inquisitive mind and crave for knowledge through “Tell me Why”, question and answer Forum, 			Creative corners etc. in smartindia.
        </p>
        <h4><u>Strategy</u></h4>
        <p style="line-height:25px;">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A holistic approach is used to plan and implement the scholastic and  soft  skills among students. This approach is based on the combination of several 			programmes and activities. Continuous and comprehensive evaluation tests after each topic student learned in the class, in the form of chapter test, subject test and general tests, 				are the first approach to practice and develop the skills. It also includes the approach of embedding the remedial teaching in the continuous and comprehensive evaluation tests, 				answer sheets, class notes and smart corners across the curriculum.

        <p style="line-height:25px;">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not require the student to take special courses for each subject. Instead, the students are trained to master the subjects through various tests 				and activities. The learning outcomes related to the subject wise/ chapter wise tests will be integrated and be part of the learning outcomes of the respective lessons. This is 				followed by implementing several teaching and learning activities such as questioning, class discussion, brain storming, team work, presentation, task/projects etc.

A quality human 				capital comes from a quality education process. A carefully designed and well planned education system is critical to developing such human capital. Thus, smartindia.net.in plays a 				very important role to produce a human capital that is highly knowledgeable and skillful to meet the demand and expectations of many people.
